Mobile-Recon-Toolkit
🛡️ Nigerian Infrastructure Security Research
This project documents my journey as a 16-year-old Security Researcher focusing on protecting digital assets in Nigeria.

🛠️ Tools I Use in Termux:
- **Shodan**: To map exposed IP ranges and find "glitches" in public systems.
- **Nmap**: To verify open ports and check service versions.
- **Gobuster**: To find hidden directories and subdomains on web servers.

🎯 The Mission
My goal is to identify vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure (like billboards and fintech servers) and report them ethically to help secure the Nigerian tech ecosystem.
